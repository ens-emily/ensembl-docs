# Other types of regulatory data

## DNA Methylation

Ensembl Regulation resources also provide hyper- and hypo-methylated [CpGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site), as these have been studied using Reduced Representation [Bisulfite Sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisulfite_sequencing) (RRBS) assays on forty five cell lines and Whole Genome Bisulphite Sequencing (WGBS) assays on two cell lines.

## Other Regulatory Data

Ensembl Regulation databases also store data directly imported from external sources:

* Predicted transcription start sites and enhancers from the [FANTOM5](http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/) project
* microRNA target predictions for human and mouse using [Diana TarBase](http://diana.imis.athena-innovation.gr/DianaTools/index.php?r=tarbase/index)
* Experimentally validated human enhancers from the [VISTA Browser](https://enhancer.lbl.gov/)
* NGG CRISPR sites identified by the [Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Genome Editing](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/htgt/wge/) group
* Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data from 44 cell types from the [Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project](http://www.gtexportal.org/home/).
