# Ensembl Variation

The Ensembl Variation database stores areas of the genome that differ between individual genomes ("variants") and, where available, associated disease and phenotype information.  
There are different types of variants for several species:

*   single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
*   short nucleotide insertions and/or deletions
*   longer variants classified as structural variants (including CNVs)
