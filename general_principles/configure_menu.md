# Configure this Page

Throughout Ensembl you'll see a blue button on the left hand side asking you to "Configure this page".

This allows you to customise the view to see the data that interests you, in a format that is useful to you. Click on the button to open a pop-up menu.

In the [Region in detail] view this will allow you to add or remove tracks and in the sequence views it will allow you to change highlighting or line numbering. [Individual help pages] will explain some of the options available for configuring.
