# Share Links

If you copy and paste a URL from an Ensembl page into an email and send it to a colleague, you might notice that they can't see exactly what you can. This is because if you [configure the page](configure_this_page.md), those changes are not saved in the web address, and they won't be able to see the extra tracks you've added.

To send *all* the data you're looking at use the Share button:

![Share](share.png)

This will generate a permanent link to the page you're looking at, with all the customisation you've added. If you've added any [custom tracks] it will give you the option of including them too.
