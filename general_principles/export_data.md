# Export Data

Data can be exported from Ensembl pages in various formats. Because we're open access, all the data and images you export are free to be used and reproduced in papers, presentations and websites.

We respectfully request that you do not script against the export pages on the Ensembl website, as this degrades the service for other web visitors. We provide various large scale export options, including [BioMart], the [Perl APIs], the [REST API], the [MySQL server] and the [FTP site], depending on the volume and type of export you're carrying out.
