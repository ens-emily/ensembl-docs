# Gene Naming

## Human genes

Most human protein-coding genes have an associated HGNC symbol from the [HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee](http://www.genenames.org/).

ncRNA genes are given names from miRBase and RFAM.

'Clone-based' identifiers apply to transcripts that cannot be associated with an HGNC symbol.

The list of gene name categories for human is as follows:

* HGNC automatic
* HGNC curated
* Clone-based Ensembl
* Clone-based Vega

## Other species

Mouse genes are named from [MGI](http://www.informatics.jax.org/), rat genes are named from [RGD](http://rgd.mcw.edu/) and zebrafish genes are named from [ZFIN](https://zfin.org/). Other species have gene names imported from [Uniprot](http://www.uniprot.org/) and [NCBIGene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene), or if this is not available, from the human, mouse, rat or zebrafish orthologue.

## Transcript numbering

Each transcript is named using the gene name, followed by a number. If the number starts with '0', eg 001, 002, etc, this is a merged or manually curated transcript from Havana/Vega. If the number starts with '2', such as 200, 201, etc, this is an automatically annotated transcript from Ensembl. This does not take the place of the Ensembl gene ID, ENSG..., which is stable from release to release, and has not changed.
