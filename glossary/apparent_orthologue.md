word: "Apparent orthologue"
definition: "Apparent orthologues occur when genes in different species have homology to one another, but we have reason to believe that they are not directly orthologous to each other. For example, this may occur when there has been a gene duplication but in both species we only have one gene. This may be due to gaps in the genome assemblies, gene deletions or degradation to pseudogenes. These genes are actually between species paralogues, but based on our data we cannot say for certain that the two genes are not orthologues that have significantly diverged."
