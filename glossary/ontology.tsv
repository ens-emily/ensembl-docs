1	Homologues		Specific sequences that are descended from the same common sequence in an ancestor.	Homologs	
2	Orthologues	1	Orthologues are genes derived from a common ancestor through vertical descent (or speciation) and can be thought of as the direct evolutionary counterpart.	Orthologs	
3	1-to-1 orthologues	2	A type of orthologue assigned for a pair of species where only one copy is found in each species.	1-to-1 orthologs, one-to-one orthologues, one-to-one orthologs	
4	1-to-many orthologues	2	A type of orthologue assigned for a pair of species where one gene in one species is orthologous to multiple genes in the other species, due to (a) duplication event(s) in the second species.	1-to-many orthologs, one-to-many orthologues, one-to-many orthologs	
5	Many-to-many orthologues	2	A type of orthologue assigned for a pair of species where multiple orthologues are found in both species, where the duplication events in both species occurred after the speciation event. many-to-many orthologs
