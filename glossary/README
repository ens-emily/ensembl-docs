Glossary entries should look like:

---
word: the word you're defining
definition: the definition. Should be no more than three sentences. Any longer should be a proper separate document, which can be linked from the glossary
synonyms: list
related terms: list of words that also appear in the glosssary
alternative uses: list of words that also appear in the glossary (probably only used for things like haplotype)
