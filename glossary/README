Glossary entries should look like:

---
key: a_keyword_with_no_spaces_that_matches_the_filename
word: "the word you're defining in quote marks"
definition: "the definition in quote marks. Should be no more than three sentences. Any longer should be a proper separate document, which can be linked from the glossary"
synonyms: "list, words in quotes, separated by comma"
related terms: list of keys to words that also appear in the glosssary, separated by commas
alternative uses: list of keys to words that also appear in the glossary (probably only used for things like haplotype)

---
 The file name should be the phrase with underscores for spaces, saved as markdown.
