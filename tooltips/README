Tooltip entries should look like:

---
word: "the word you're defining in quote marks"
definition: "the definition in quote marks. Should be no more than one sentence. Any longer should be a proper separate document, which can be linked from the tooltip"
tool: the tool where this tip should appear

---
 The file name should be the phrase with underscores for spaces, saved as markdown.
