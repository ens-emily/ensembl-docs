## Style Guide

### Text

| Type | Style | How to apply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nomenclature | RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, Ensembl, VEP, variant (noun), variation (adjective)	| |
| Person | 2nd person (you) |	|
| Voice | Active | |	
| Paragraph spacing | Double space between paragraphs, no indent.	| |
| Sentence spacing | Single space between sentences. | |	
| Header style | Page title Heading 1. Reduce heading number by one as you go into deeper subsections. | |
| Header capitalisation | Title case, where the first word and all important words are capitalised, but not pronouns, conjunctions etc, for example "How Gene Trees are Determined" or "Sources of Variation Data". Exception, a latin species name in a title should still be in the form *Genus species*.	| |
| Links in text | Avoid filling a paragraph with links. If you think a paragraph needs lots of associated links, you should put a list after the paragraph, rather than making every other phrase in the paragraph a link. Do not put the URL in the text, unless there is a very good reason to do so (eg " this is how you construct a REST URL"), link from a descriptive phrase (eg "[this FAQ] describes this in detail", not "The following FAQ describes this in detail: www.ensembl.org/uglylookingurl"). Never use "Click [here] to view thing", "[thing] is a tool for..." is much better.	| |
| Bullet points | Round bullets, indent the lines following the bullet | |
| Numbered lists | 1. 2. 3. etc, indent lines following the number. Subsections in the form a) b) c), then (i) (ii) (iii) | |
| Page titles | Where you mention an Ensembl page in the text (eg "You can view this in the Region in detail view"), the titles should always perfectly match the titles on the pages themselves, even down to case. Link out to an example page wherever relevant.	| |
| Integers ≤ twelve |	Write the word	| |
| Numbers ≥ 13 or with decimals | Use digits	| |
| Oxford commas | Do not use, this is Cambridge	| |
| Not only..., but also... | Do not use, very confusing for non-native speakers	| |
| Dots in abbreviations | Do not use: etc, Dr, EMBL-EBI	| |
| Spelling, grammar and punctuation | Should always be perfect. | Get someone else (preferably a native English-speaker) to proof-read. |
| Readability | Everything should be easy to follow, even for non-native speakers. | Get a non-native English speaker to proof-read. |
| British spelling	| Homologue, colour, realise, centre. Exception: hemoglobin, fetal etc (these words usually appear from external databases who use the American spelling, we should match the database) | |
| "user" | Never refer to "users". This should not be a problem as you're already writing in the second-person active voice.	| |
| Paragraphing | Write in proper paragraphs where related sentences grouped together. Do not create a new paragraph for each sentence. If it feels like you're writing lots of short paragraphs like this, consider if they ought to be bullet points instead. | |	
| Images | Use as often as possible – so much more informative than text.	| |
| References in the text | If there are a papers or links relevant to the whole page, then include a summary at the end with links. If there are references which relate to specific parts of the text, then put the reference and link in brackets following that text.	| |
| Gene and protein names | Gene names should be in italics, eg "*BRCA2* is found on chromosome 13". Protein names should not, eg "BRCA2 is involved in telomere maintenance".	| |
| Latin species names | In italics, the genus should be capitalised and the species lower-case, eg *Homo sapiens*. | |
| Papers | Always link to Europe PMC. Never link to NCBI PubMed. | |

### Images

| Type | Style | How to apply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Taking a good screenshot | Screenshots should contain all the information needed and no more. They should not contain too much white space at the edges. Text in tables should not overflow or overlap messily. | Resize your browser to give an aesthetically pleasing shot. |
| Screenshot accuracy | Do not remove columns from tables or configure a page for a screenshot, unless you have stated in the accompanying text that you have done so. The user should be able to immediately see how to get to where you are. | |	
| Labels | Labels should be in a square-cornered speech bubble with the arrow pointing to the item in question. White box with a 1pt black outline. Text should be in Arial bold, size 12, black. Avoid overlapping labels. Resize the box so that there is no excess white space. If labels will be side-by-side or stacked on top of each other, they should match up at the edges.	| |
| Legends | If you create a legend in an image it should appear within a box named "*stuff* legend". The box should be a square-cornered white rectangle with 1pt black outline. Text should be in size 12 Arial with the legend title in bold. Images should appear on the left with the definition on the right. You may use columns in the legend for reasons of space. Your legend "*stuff* legend" should have a corresponding "*stuff*" label pointing to what the legend refers to, making it easy to see what's what. You may also consider just putting the legend in the text. | |
| Icons in text | Small icons may be better as part of the text than as a figure by themselves. The image should be similar height to the text.	| |
