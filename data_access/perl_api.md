# Perl API

Ensembl uses MySQL relational databases to store its information. A comprehensive set of Application Program Interfaces (APIs) serve as a middle-layer between underlying database schemes and more specific application programmes. The APIs aim to encapsulate the database layout by providing efficient high-level access to data tables and isolate applications from data layout changes.
