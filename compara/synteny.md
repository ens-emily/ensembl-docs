# Synteny

When both species have a chromosome-level assembly, we summarise the LastZ-net alignment blocks into syntenic regions. We look for stretches where the alignment blocks are in synteny. The search is run in two phases. In the first one, syntenic alignments that are closer than 200 kbp are grouped. In the second phase, the groups that are in synteny are linked provided that no more than 2 non-syntenic groups are found between them and they are less than 3 Mb apart.

Here is the list of all the synteny comparisons that are available:
