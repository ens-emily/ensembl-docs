# Conservation scores and constrained elements

We use [Gerp](http://mendel.stanford.edu/SidowLab/downloads/gerp/) to calculate conservation scores and call constrained elements on the Mercator/Pecan and EPO-2X [multiple alignments](multiple_genome_alignment.md).

## Conservation scores
Conservation scores are estimated on a column-by-column basis.

## Constrained elements
Constrained elements are stretches of the multiple alignment where the sequences are highly conserved according to the previous score.
